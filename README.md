# TWIML x IBM AI Enterprise Workflow Study Group

This winter/spring I've been hosting a TWIML study group for the [IBM AI Enterprise Workflow specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-ai-workflow) on Coursera. The specialization consists of six courses that progressively walk the learner through the experience of building and deploying a real-world enterprise AI solutions, from establishing business priorities and a data pipeline through to deploying and managing your model in production.

This repository contains my notes and notebooks from the courses. The repo is organized by course, and within each course the filename will denote which week the resource pertains.

The notes (*-study-group-slides.pdf) were presented during our Saturday study group sessions. You can access the recordings of these via the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILZm3MRkvH8NwZ6-rv9fhes28IRZjpMa).
